**Autism Detection Bot**
**Overview**
Autism Detection Bot is a concept-driven application that explores the use of software logic and basic machine learning principles to support early indicators related to autism spectrum characteristics through structured interaction.
The project focuses on problem decomposition, input handling, and response logic rather than medical diagnosis, emphasizing responsible use of technology.
**Problem Statement--**
Early identification of autism-related indicators can be challenging due to limited accessibility and awareness. This project investigates how a software-driven conversational interface can assist in collecting structured inputs and generating informative responses.
**Technical Approach--**
Designed a rule-based and logic-driven interaction flow
Implemented structured input processing
Applied basic data handling and conditional logic to generate outputs
Focused on clarity, maintainability, and extensibility
**Tech Stack--**
Language: Python
Tools: Git, GitHub
Concepts: Conditional logic, basic data processing, conversational flow design
**Features--**
Interactive chatbot-style interface
Structured question-and-response flow
Input validation and basic error handling
Modular code structure for future expansion
